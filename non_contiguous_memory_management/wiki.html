            <h1> Introduction</h1>
            <p> Main Memory refers to a physical memory that is the internal memory to the computer. The word main is used to distinguish it from external mass storage devices such as disk drives. Main memory is also known as RAM. The computer is able to change only data that is in main memory. Therefore, every program we execute and every file we access must be copied from a storage device into main memory.</p>
        </div> -->
        
        <div>
            <h1>Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation</h1>   
            <p>In the non-contiguous memory allocation, the available free memory space is not continuous but is scattered over the memory. In this method, the memory allocated to a process will not be at one place but at different locations according to the process requirement. This technique overcomes the drawbacks of contiguous memory allocation such as memory wastage due to internal and external fragmentation. It is also more flexible.Spanning is also allowed in this technique. This utilizes all the free space created by a different process.</p> 
        </div>
            <p>Non-Contiguous Memory allocation is of three types:

            <h2>Paging</h2>
            <p>Paging is very important in implementing virtual memory. Virtual memory is a part of secondary memory space which acts as if it were a part of the main memory. The actual main memory is referred to as the physical address space while the virtual memory is referred to as the logical address space.The physical address space is divided into fixed-size blocks, called frames. The logical address is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages. The page size is the same as that of the frame size. The mapping of virtual to physical address is done by the memory management unit (MMU) and this mapping is known as paging technique.</p>

            <p>Every process will have a separate page table. Each entry in a page table stores a frame number(f) and optitional status bits of frame offset(d). The status bits are used in the virtual memory system. The frame number combined with frame offset gives the corresponding physical address. Size of a page table is generally very large so cannot be accommodated inside the PCB, therefore, PCB contains a register value PTBR( page table base register) which leads to the page table.</p>

            <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Frame number :</h5>
                            <p>It gives the frame number of the frame which contains the page one is looking for. It is also known as the address translation bit.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Present/Absent bit :</h5>
                            <p>It says whether the page one is looking for is present or not. In case if it is not present, that is called a page fault.</p>
                        </li>    
                        <li>
                            <h5>Protection bit :</h5>
                            <p>It says about what kind of protection is on that page. </p>
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                            <h5>Referenced bit :</h5>
                            <p> It says if the page is referred in the last cycle or not.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Caching enabled/disabled  bit :</h5>
                            <p>This is to enable or disable the caching of the page.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Dirty bit :</h5>
                            <p>It says if the page is modified or not. It is also called the Modified bit.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>The translation becomes very slow as the main memory has to be accessed twice.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>A page table adds the overhead to the system as it occupies considerable space.</p>

            <h2>Segmentation</h2>
            <p>In this technique, a program is divided into several segments of different sizes. All the segements need not be resident on the main memory at any one point of time. Also, when the segments are loaded into the memory, they are not necessarily contiguous. All the information about the segments is stored in Segment Table. </p>
            <p>Segment table maps two-dimensional logical address into one-dimensional physical address. It's each table entry has :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h5>Base Address : </h5>
                    <p>It contains the starting physical address of the segments in memory.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Limit :</h5>
                    <p>It specifies the length of the segment.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Advantages :</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>No Internal fragmentation.</p>
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <p>Segment Table consumes less space in comparison to Page table in paging.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages :</h4>
            <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>As processes are loaded and removed from the memory, the free memory space is broken into little pieces, causing External fragmentation.</p>
                        </li>
                </ul>

        <div>
            <h2>Segmentation with paging</h2>
            <p>This technique takes advantages of both segmentation as well as paging. A process is first divided into segments and then each segment is divided into pages. These pages are stored in the main memory frames. A page table exists for each segment which keeps track of the pages of that segment. Each page table occupies one frame in the main memory. A segment table keeps track of the frames storing the page tables of the segments. The base address of the segment table is stored in the segment table base register. </p>

            <h4>Advantages :</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Segment table contains only one entry corresponding to each segment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It reduces memory usage.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Ths size of page table is limited by the segment size.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It solves the problem of external fragmentation.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>It suffers from internal fragmentation.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The complexity level is much higher as compared to paging.</p>
